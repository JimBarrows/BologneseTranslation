BologneseTranslation
====================

Translating the various manuscripts in the Bolognese Martial Arts Traditions.  The folder marked Original Manuals is where you'll be able to find scans of the original manuals we're translating.  Once we have a manual, we'll begin the process of copying that text into the Untranslated Texts directory, then we'll do a literal translation and finally a full interpretation of the texts.

We're breaking these up like this so anyone can see the flow of how we went from the original hand written text in a foreign language to the interpreted book you may prefer to read.  This will allow us to see where errors creep in, and also to help ensure the best possible translation.

The Encyclopedia is where we'll bring all of the texts together so you have one reference point for every ward, blow, play and assault in all of the manuals.  We'll also resolve terminology differences and other differences between the manuals.

If you find errors, please first check our issues list and then if it's not already there, please add it!
